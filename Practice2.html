  <h1>The Thirty Years War</h1>
  <h4>1618 - 1648</h4>
    <p>The Thirty Years War was a religious conflict that took place mostly in the Holy Roman Empire.
    The War began with the Defenestration of Prague in the Spring of 1618, but the true roots of the
    conflict lay in the dynastic ambitions of the Hapsburg and Bourbon monarchies, among other causes.
    The effects were devasting for the population.  An estimated 8 million people died during the conflict.
